# 🤖 Bronx Bot

> Because who needs a social life when you can write Discord bots?

A multi-purpose Discord bot that probably won't break your server. (No promises.)

---

## ✨ Features

- **Vote-bans**: Democracy in action (timeout edition)
- **ModMail**: Like email, but with more chaos
- **Role Sync**: Because copy-paste is too hard
- **Economy**: Capitalism simulator with games, shops, and leaderboards
- **Games**: Pretend you're having fun (slots, blackjack, coinflip, and more)
- **Utility**: Actually useful stuff (rare, but it happens)
- [**Dashboard**](https://bronxbot.onrender.com/): Setup and manage the bot using a web UI!

See [FEATURES.md](FEATURES.md) for the full feature list (it's longer than your todo list).
